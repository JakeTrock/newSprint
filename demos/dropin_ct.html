    If you're a blogger or anyone who makes things to read on the web, you have a problem. While there are people with the energy and ability to read long pieces, there are often people stuck using phones with resolutions not well suited to reading, or people who lack the attention span to read something longer than a page. Frankly, I have found myself as both of these people due to my reading habits. So how can you expand your audience to people in these predicaments? I'd suggest using NewSprint on your site. NewSprint has a twofold advantage. The former advantage is that it is better for your eyes by advancing text for you so you don't have to move your eyes and by having a large font that can fill the page, as it only needs to display one word at a time. The latter advantage is that because you no longer have to move your eyes or strain to make out words, you can read much faster than you would otherwise. These advantages can make content more welcoming to smaller screens and shorter attention spans, two demographics which are highly represented. Here are some features of NewSprint:

    <ul>
        <li class="sprtxt"><a href="https://example.com">links</a>, which are commonplace in most blogs.</li>
        <li class="sprtxt">custom output location(passed in the second argument, if you wish to remove the NewSprint popup via dom manipulation)</li>
        <li class="sprtxt">custom css(which can be passed into the nsprint function as a link in the third argument)</li>
        <li class="sprtxt">adaptable reading, by utilizing the mozilla readability library</li>
        <li class="sprtxt">low filesize, the dropin button is only 440 bytes, the main program is only 3.4k</li>
    </ul>
